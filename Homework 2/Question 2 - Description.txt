X^16 = 65536

I followed a devide and conquer, pipelined  approach in this question.
Process 1 receives X from master process, and performs X*X
Process 2 receives X^2 from process 1, and performs (X^2)*(X^2)

This process continues when process 4 sends the output X^16 to master process which in return prints the value.
