	Here we observe amdahl's law which says the decrease in execution time is limited by the code that cannot be parallelized.
	We see execution time nears to 3.5 seconds and only shrinks marginally even though we are doubling the number of processes from 10 to 20.
	
	As we decrease the accuracy level (epsilon) time taken is decreased to find a solution that lies in given accuracy level.
	
  b)
No. of processes    Execution time    epsilon = 0.00001
	1				2m45.369s			
	2				2m1.337s
	5				0m36.638s
	10				0m15.175s
	20				0m8.727s
											epsilon
	20 				0m2.068s					0.0001
	20 				0m1.561s					0.001
	20				0m1.401s					0.01`
	
	
	
	This is same as the above observation so increase in speedup is limited by the serial code that cannot be parallelized.
	Increasing no. of processes after a level will not decrease the time as it will add a lot of process communication overhead.
	
	As we decrease the accuracy level i.e. epsilon, time taken is decreased to find a solution that lies in given accuracy level.
